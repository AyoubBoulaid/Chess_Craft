## **The Story**

Chess Craft was inspired by my love for chess and my passion for software development. I wanted to create a chess game that was both visually engaging and challenging for players of all skill levels. Initially, my focus was on developing a player-vs-player mode with a simple yet appealing design. However, the project quickly evolved to include AI integration, allowing players to challenge a computer opponent powered by the Stockfish engine. The game aims to offer an experience that feels both modern and true to the timeless appeal of chess.

One of the key motivations behind Chess Craft was to create a platform that enhances the learning experience for new players while still providing advanced features and difficulty levels for seasoned chess enthusiasts. Over time, I have implemented various features such as undo and hint buttons, and different levels of AI difficulty to make the game more dynamic and user-friendly.
